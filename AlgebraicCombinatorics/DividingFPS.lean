/-! ### Section: Conventions

We identify each element `a ∈ K` with the constant FPS `(a, 0, 0, 0, ...)`.
In Mathlib, this is handled via the ring homomorphism `algebraMap K (PowerSeries K)`.
-/

/-- The constant FPS corresponding to an element of the base ring.
This is `algebraMap K (PowerSeries K)` in Mathlib. -/

/-! ### Section: Inverses in commutative rings

The uniqueness of inverses and notation for fractions are standard in Mathlib.
We recall the key facts here for reference.
-/

/-- **Theorem (thm.commring.inverse-uni)**: In a commutative ring, inverses are unique.
If `a * b = 1` and `a * c = 1`, then `b = c`.
This follows from Mathlib's `left_inv_eq_right_inv`. -/
theorem inverse_unique {L : Type*} [CommRing L] {a b c : L}
    (hb : a * b = 1) (hc : a * c = 1) : b = c := by
  have hb' : b * a = 1 := by rw [mul_comm]; exact hb
  exact left_inv_eq_right_inv hb' hc

/-- Variant of `inverse_unique`: if `a` is a unit, any element `b` with `a * b = 1`
equals the canonical inverse `ha.unit⁻¹`. -/
theorem inverse_unique_of_isUnit {L : Type*} [CommRing L] {a : L} (ha : IsUnit a)
    {b : L} (hb : a * b = 1) : b = ha.unit⁻¹ := by
  have : a * ↑ha.unit⁻¹ = 1 := IsUnit.mul_val_inv ha

/-! ### Section: Properties of inverses and fractions (prop.commring.fracs.1)

**Proposition (prop.commring.fracs.1)**: Let `L` be a commutative ring. Then:
- **(a)** Any invertible element `a ∈ L` satisfies `a⁻¹ = 1/a`.
- **(b)** For any invertible elements `a, b ∈ L`, the element `ab` is invertible as well,
  and satisfies `(ab)⁻¹ = b⁻¹a⁻¹ = a⁻¹b⁻¹`.
- **(c)** If `a ∈ L` is invertible, and if `n ∈ ℤ` is arbitrary, then `a^{-n} = (a⁻¹)^n = (a^n)⁻¹`.
- **(d)** Laws of exponents hold for negative exponents as well.
- **(e)** Laws of fractions hold: `b/a + d/c = (bc + ad)/(ac)` and `(b/a) · (d/c) = (bd)/(ac)`.
- **(f)** Division undoes multiplication: `c/a = b` iff `c = ab`.

In Mathlib, these are mostly standard lemmas for `Units` and `IsUnit`.

/-! ### Section: Inverses in K[[x]]

**Proposition (prop.fps.invertible)**: An FPS `a` is invertible in `K[[x]]` if and only if
its constant term `[x^0] a` is invertible in `K`.

This is `PowerSeries.isUnit_iff_constantCoeff` in Mathlib.

Explicit formulas for the coefficients of the inverse of an FPS.

Label: fps_inv_coeff_zero -/

/-- Recurrence for coefficients of the inverse of an FPS.
For n > 0: `[x^n]f⁻¹ = -(f₀)⁻¹ · ∑_{k=1}^n f_k · [x^{n-k}]f⁻¹`

This is a reformulation of Mathlib's `PowerSeries.coeff_inv` that expresses the
recurrence in terms of a sum over `Finset.range (n + 1)` with shifted indices,
which matches the standard textbook formula.

The recurrence shows that each coefficient of `f⁻¹` can be computed from:
- The constant term `f₀` (which must be nonzero for `f` to be invertible)
- The coefficients `f₁, f₂, ..., f_n` of `f`
- The previously computed coefficients `[x^0]f⁻¹, [x^1]f⁻¹, ..., [x^{n-1}]f⁻¹`
